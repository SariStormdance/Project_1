Introduction 

The Austin Animal Center runs the largest no-kill animal shelter in the US and provides shelter to over 18,000 animals each year. They offer Event Requests for community outreach and classes in responsible pet ownership. These pets are fixed, microchipped, have their vaccinations, and currently adoption fees are being waived. Yet, they still have a problem with overcrowded facilities and are currently not accepting new intakes.  

Project goal 

We will be reviewing the Center’s 2022 public records to analyze the percentage of outgoing cats and dogs via adoptions, reunifications, and transfers to see if there is a significant correlation between pet rehoming and season. Finally, we will evaluate existing funded programs, and assess how the Center can encourage more people to adopt. 

Process 

We sourced our data from the official City of Austin open data portal. While we initially intended to retrieve data using JSONs, this method limited us to one thousand records. We switched to CSV retrieval to ensure we got the full subset of 2022’s records. Data showed that the animal center handles many kinds of animals including wildlife and livestock. We focused on cats and dogs since they made up the majority of the outcome records. In our pie chart “Types of Animals Handled…”, all other animals were combined and categorized as “Other”. 

Analysis  

	Cat Outcomes 

We examined the top 3 cat outtake results. We found a total of 3194 cats were adopted over the course of the year. 1117 transfers were carried out. 183 humans were successfully reunited with their overlords. 

	Cat Adoption Rates 

Our analysis aimed to investigate the seasonal variations in cat adoption rates throughout the year. The findings revealed a distinct trend in cat adoption rates during different seasons. The summer months, particularly August exhibited a significant increase while spring had a decrease with March being the lowest. 

	Dog outcomes 

After analyzing the top 3 outtake results for dogs, We discovered that during the year 2022, there were a total of 3,410 adoptions, 1,782 transfers, and 1,074 instances where dogs were successfully returned to their respective owners.  

	Dog adoptions 

Next we looked at dog adoption rates 
We also found within the analysis that there were a peak in adoption rates in August, and January coming in as a close second, with the lowest month being October 

Funding 

The funding for this shelter is sourced from tax grants, fees, and private donations from individuals within the community. The Center has several established programs that offer free and low-cost services to the community including free spays and neuters, microchipping, and vaccinations.  

Increasing Adoption Rates 

 Proactively marketing these services as well as continued advertising of pet services and live-stream adoption events during low adoption times may be able to increase the overall rate of rehoming. 

Next Steps for the Project 

	Audit  

In July 2022, a resolution was passed by Austin City Council that the Office of the City Auditor conduct an audit of the effectiveness of the Animal Services Office. The Audit Team wants to understand the priorities of the community and prompts citizens to fill out a survey to narrow down the main concerns. The final report will be released this summer. 

	Meet My Match 

June 7, Austin Animal Center started a pilot program called Meet My Match. The Center is open by appointment only 2 days a week enabling a more individualized experience in matching an animal with the right family while also freeing up time for staff to focus more on reunification efforts for lost pets.  

Cats and Dogs by breed 

Various factors, including temperament, appearance, and lifestyle compatibility, influence the adoption choices of potential pet owners. Here we took a look at adoptions by breed. We see the most adopted cat is the domestic short hair and most adopted dog breed is pit bull.  

Conclusion 

By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pet adoption trends and factors influencing adoption rates in Austin, the findings of this project can serve as a valuable resource for animal shelters, rescue organizations, and policymakers. Existing resources may be reallocated to target slower adoption months.  Expanding the Center’s reach with satellite sites may help them reach more potential adopters. Implementing data-driven strategies can lead to increased adoption rates, reduced shelter overcrowding, and ultimately improve the welfare of pets in the city of Austin.
